Started an open-source F# reimagination of some ideas first explored on the
IOT project.

This ASP.NET Core framework enables quick implementation of CRUD REST APIs
out of chains of simple, composable handlers dealing with various aspects of an API,
like data storage, change notification, access control, DTO mapping, or specific
business logic.

The framework focuses on providing great and accurate Swagger documentation
for the APIs with minimum effort on the developer&rsquo;s part.
