Led a small team of developers implementing an Azure-based industrial IOT project.
Architected both the .NET back-end and the Angular front-ends.

visualizing real-time data received via SignalR. Created a common UI component
library implementing customer&rsquo;s visual identity using functional CSS approach.

Oversaw the development of a generic JSON filtering and mapping engine inspired by MongoDB
query language. Created infrastructure for real-time processing, aggregation,
storage and forwarding of the acquired telemetry.
